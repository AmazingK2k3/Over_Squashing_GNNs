# Addressing the Oversquashing Problem in Graph Neural Networks

## Overview

This repository contains experiments and implementations aimed at addressing the oversquashing problem encountered in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Oversquashing occurs when the model compresses too much information into a single node, leading to performance degradation, especially in tasks involving long-range dependencies in graph-structured data.This repo carries out different experiments to address the oversquashing issue. Currently under works
